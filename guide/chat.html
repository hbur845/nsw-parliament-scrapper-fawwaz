            join us in the gallery today. They earn up to 30 per cent less than teachers in schools doing similar work,
            and around 15 per cent less than staff in long day care. Families trust their children with these people
            every day. Why will the Government not fund a fair pay rise for the incredible work they do?</span> </p> <a

            would have been welcomed when the Opposition was in government. The truth is that over the 12 years that the
            previous Government was in power there was record low investment in that area of public spending. The former
            Liberal‑Nationals Government did not build a single public preschool in New South Wales in 12 years. As a
            result, there is a massive differential between the number of private providers and public and community
            providers in Victoria versus New South Wales. Most of the childcare deserts in our State are funded by
            private providers because there are no public providers. As a result, the Government has stepped into the
            breach and announced the largest early childhood education investment, which includes 100 new preschools in
            the State, 49 of which will be in regional New South Wales. The reason for that is straightforward.</span>
