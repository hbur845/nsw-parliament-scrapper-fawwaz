            resume my second reading speech on the Summary Offences and Other Legislation Amendment (Public Assemblies)
            Bill 2025. As I started to say on the last occasion, the bill deals with some of the less satisfactory
            events that have taken place in our community in recent times. Two weekends ago, for the second time since
            July, we saw a Nazi protest outside of Parliament and Nazis using the symbol of our democracy as a sort of
            vindication for their vile views, which divide communities, set citizen against citizen and seek to
            dismantle one of the great multicultural experiments of the world, as we have been able achieve in New South
            Wales and more broadly in Australia. </span> </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span
            class="Normal-H">We all know the statistics: Well over 50 per cent of the population of New South Wales
            either was born overseas or has one at least parent born overseas. We have an incredibly diverse community.
            To allow thugs—there is no other word for them—to lawfully roam around our streets causing social division
            is not what people in the State want. My bill will give the police and the courts power to make the kind of
            protests that we saw outside of Parliament unlawful and therefore make them not occur. I believe, and the
            Coalition believes, that is in the best interest of the New South Wales public. </span> </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span
            class="Normal-H">The bill has been rejected on a number of occasions by the Labor Party, The Greens and the
            Independents in this Chamber. If this reintroduced bill passes through Parliament, it will give power to the
            police and the courts to stop extremists protesting in our streets, like the Nazis did outside our
            Parliament, and appropriating our national symbols—like the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge and Parliament
            House—for their undesirable causes. If the bill passes through Parliament, it will also allow the courts,
            subject to the constitutional implied right of freedom of political communication, to say to potential
            protesters, "Your group has already protested three times this year, at great cost to the taxpayer in terms
            of policing and the diversion of resources away from things like domestic violence, youth crime and other
            things that impact our community. If you want to lawfully hold more than three protests, then conditions
            will be placed on you so that you pay for some or all of the policing costs and other costs that arise."
        </span> </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span
            class="Normal-H">It is not mandatory that that be imposed. All of the circumstances of the case can be
            looked at. If the three previous protests had been five people outside Parliament House, with no diversion
            of policing resources, then they do not need to expend policing resources on the fourth one. But in the past
            couple of years, policing these protests has cost the taxpayer tens of millions of dollars. In the
            circumstance of a massive protest, the bill will make it possible for some of those costs to be borne by the
            protesters and the organisers of those protests, rather than the taxpayer, as a condition of them getting
            approval for more protests. We believe that is a commonsense proposal. The Premier actually floated an idea
            that there should be some recovery. Unfortunately, the Premier, the Labor Party, The Greens and the
            Independents did not support that when I brought a bill before the Parliament in the past; I am now
            reintroducing that through this bill. </span> </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span
            class="Normal-H">We have seen that these extremist groups like to hide their faces. They do not like to take
            personal responsibility for the vile ideology that they are spewing in our community. Another thing the bill
            will do is give the police the power to pull out the protesters who are disguising their appearance, unless
            it is for good religious reasons; they can go back to the protest only if they remove their face coverings
            and stop hiding their identity. Modern technologies of photography and film assists police in the
            identification of people doing illegal activities within a protest. That is thwarted if people are allowed
            to hide their appearance. Therefore, if these groups want to continue to lawfully protest, then they need to
            take responsibility for their actions and not hide their appearance. </span> </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span
            class="Normal-H">Those are the three key measures within the bill—all quite reasonable, one would think. I
            guess the rhetorical questions are these. Why have the Premier, the Labor Party, The Greens and the
            Independents voted against these commonsense measures on more than one occasion this year? Why did they
            force my last bill to lapse so that I have to reintroduce it and give another second reading speech? I think
            they are legitimate questions that the public should be asking, keeping in mind the provisions in my bill.
            For the benefit of members, I will go through the details of my bill so that they can read it in<span
                class="NormalItalicsChar-H">Hansard</span>—or maybe they are listening in their offices—and understand
            what the bill provides. At the moment we have a regime that does not force police officers on the ground to
            make difficult legal determinations about the lawfulness of a public assembly as it is happening. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span
            class="Normal-H">The process under the Summary Offences Act is that, more than seven days before a protest,
            the organisers need to go to the police to seek a form 1, which is an approval for the protest if it is
            conducted in accordance with the time, the route and other conditions that may be imposed by police. If the
            protest is conducted in accordance with those conditions then it is deemed a lawful protest. If organisers
            are knocked back because, for example, the police are unsatisfied with the protest or it is less than seven
            days beforehand, there is a provision to apply to the Supreme Court for a judicial determination on whether
            the protest should be allowed. At the moment, when it goes to court, the argument is essentially only around
            whether the proposal for the protest would promote public safety. No consideration is given to other aspects
            of public interest. I want to set out a non-exhaustive list of things that the court and the police must
            take into account before they deem a protest to be a lawful protest, in advance of it taking place.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="Normal-P" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span
            class="Normal-H">The things I want considered—in addition to public safety, which is still number
            one—include the impact of the public assembly on public amenity and convenience. It is obviously not
            furthering public amenity and convenience to have Nazis parading around in the streets within our community.
            That would be an aspect that the courts could take into account, amongst other aspects of public amenity and
            convenience. Considerations would also include the adverse impacts of the public assembly on the economy,
            including businesses. For example, if repeated protests every Saturday clog up the city and stop people
            coming to do their shopping and help the economy of New South Wales, or if the proposed protest would clash
            with a sporting event or a concert—</span> </p> <a name="member" data-mode="member" data-value="41"
